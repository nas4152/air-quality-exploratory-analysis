# Air Quality Exploratory Analysis

See Instructions file for information on the source of the data.

## Plot 1

Plot 1 explores the change in total reported PM2.5 emissions in the US from 1999 
to 2008.  Sums were calculated for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 and 
plotted with a regression line.  It should be noted that despite an increase in 
reported values for each year sampled, the total reported emissions still 
decreased.

##Plot 2

Plot 2 explores the same relationship, focusing on the data from Baltimore City,
MD.  While this plot does not show a consistent decrease, the overall trend 
remains negative.  The spike in 2005 probably cannot be explained solely by the
increase in values reported, as there is only a 1.3% increase in values reported
between 2002 and 2005.  This would have to be further investigated.

##Plot 3

Plot 3 takes the air quality data from Baltimore and breaks down pm 2.5 
emissions readings by the source type.  A linear regression line was added to 
each.  While the nonpoint emission data has the most negative slope, it also has
the least correlation and the greatest range (outliers were cropped but were 
factored into regression line calculation).  The emission data from these sources
would have to be investigated further.  The non-road and point sources both
showed a decrease as well as a stronger correlation.  The on-road emission data
shows less extreme highs over time, but no change as the levels remain low.

##Plot 4

Plot 4 examines the change in coal combustion based emissions over time in the 
US.  While the medians remained low, the upper quantiles increased dramatically,
particularly between 2005 and 2008.  This shows an increase in extreme high 
values.
