## Air Quality Exploratory Analysis

# Plot 1

Plot 1 explores the change in total reported PM2.5 emissions from 1999 to 2008.
Sums were calculated for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 and plotted with 
a regression line.  It should be noted that despite an increase in reported 
values for each year sampled, the total reported emissions still decreased.
