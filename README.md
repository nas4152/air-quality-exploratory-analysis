# Air Quality Exploratory Analysis

See Instructions file for information on the source of the data.

## Plot 1

Plot 1 explores the change in total reported PM2.5 emissions in the US from 1999 
to 2008.  Sums were calculated for the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008 and 
plotted with a regression line.  It should be noted that despite an increase in 
reported values for each year sampled, the total reported emissions still 
decreased.
